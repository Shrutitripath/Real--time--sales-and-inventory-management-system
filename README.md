# Real--time--sales-and-inventory-management-system
Project Overview: The Real-Time Sales and Inventory Management Dashboard is a data-driven solution built to track and forecast sales and inventory levels across multiple locations. Using powerful forecasting algorithms, the system helps businesses optimize stock levels, predict demand, and prevent stockouts or overstock situations. The dashboard integrates seamlessly with a PostgreSQL database and uses Power BI for visualization.

Key Components: Backend (Python):

Data Cleaning: Raw sales data is cleaned and validated using Python libraries like Pandas. This process removes duplicates, handles missing values, and standardizes column names for smooth integration into the database. Data Ingestion: Cleaned data is ingested into a PostgreSQL database, updating sales and product information while avoiding duplication. Forecasting: Sales forecasting is handled using the Exponential Smoothing model, predicting future sales for the next 12 months. The model is implemented through the statsmodels library. Database (PostgreSQL):

The database stores and manages sales, products, and forecasted sales data. It is optimized for fast querying and real-time data retrieval. Tables include Products, Sales, and Forecast Sales, with relationships that enable accurate tracking and reporting of sales trends and stock levels. Visualization (Power BI):

Power BI serves as the visualization tool for generating real-time reports and dashboards. The dashboard displays sales performance, forecasts, and product insights, offering a user-friendly interface to analyze data. Reports are interactive, allowing users to drill down by store location, product category, or time periods. Key Features: Real-Time Data Ingestion and Monitoring: The system continuously ingests and processes new sales data. Sales Forecasting: The Exponential Smoothing model predicts future sales trends to help businesses anticipate demand. Downloadable Data: Users can easily download CSV files of sales, product, and forecast data directly from the web interface. Seamless Power BI Integration: Interactive dashboards provide a comprehensive view of sales performance and forecasts. Future Enhancements: Inventory Forecasting: Expanding the forecasting capabilities to predict inventory levels and automate restocking alerts. Advanced Notifications: Implementing automated email alerts for critical stock levels or sales trends. Multi-Store Support: Enhancing the system to manage multiple warehouses and store locations for a more holistic view of stock movement and sales. Conclusion: The Real-Time Sales and Inventory Management Dashboard is a powerful, scalable solution tailored for businesses looking to leverage data for better operational decisions. By integrating Python for backend processing, PostgreSQL for data storage, and Power BI for visualization, the system provides comprehensive insights into sales trends and stock levels, enabling proactive inventory management.
